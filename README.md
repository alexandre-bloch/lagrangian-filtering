# lagrangian-filtering

In this project, the use of Gaussian and Fourier low/high-pass filters in Lagrangian averaging have been investigated. More specifically these filters are employed to decompose a synthetic flow into waves and eddies. The results of this project can be a proof of concept for wider usage of these filters in atmospheric and oceanic flows. The scripts and the theoretical foundation behind this work are documented in a Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
